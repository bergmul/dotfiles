# Dotfiles

**Last Version:** 21/02/2021

My current personal dotfiles.
A very minimal snapshot of my emacs, zsh, fish and git config.

Many other settings are sync'ed via propriatary services or have their configuration outside of $HOME and require symlinks.
They are not included here for now.
In the future this repo should also include a bootstrap routine to install necessary software.

## Requirements:

Emacs:

- Spacemacs

ZSH:

- oh-my-zsh

FISH:

- Fisher
